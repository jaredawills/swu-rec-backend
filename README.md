# SWU-REC Backend

Since `http://www.swu-rec.ca` is a statically hosted website (since I can afford it and understand how 
it works) I use Python and HTML templates to procedurally generate the pages that are hosted. This repo
includes the Python, and HTML templates that make up the backend. Since I am starting this project from
scratch (again) many initial updates will include proof-of-concept .ipynb files. The final product will
include scripts that I can run to create the updated HTML with little interaction.

The previous version of the website is still up and includes information from the last time it ran in
February of 2025.

## Files:
`Card Reader.ipynb` - Proof of concept work and method testing for downloading card information from the
                      publicly available API: https://www.swu-db.com
